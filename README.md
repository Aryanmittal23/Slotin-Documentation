# üß† Machine Learning - Slotin

![Slotin ML Models](Assets/ml.png)

## üöÄ Overview of Machine Learning Models in Slotin

Slotin leverages advanced machine learning models to enhance appointment booking and user experience. Our application integrates two key models:

1. **Appointment Classification Model:** This model is fine-tuned to categorize appointments based on user input and historical data, helping optimize scheduling and resource allocation.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model:** Utilizing NLP techniques, this model analyzes user queries and feedback, providing insights and improving communication between users and service providers.



## üîç How the Appointment Classification Model Works

Our classification model is designed to enhance the booking process. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its core features and functionality:


- **Fine-Tuning:** The model has been fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of appointment data. By adjusting the parameters and optimizing the learning process, we've trained the model to accurately classify and predict appointment types and needs.

- **Classification Accuracy:** Upon processing user inputs, the model generates predictions that classify the type of appointment, allowing for tailored scheduling that meets user expectations.

- **Real-Time Inference:** The model is capable of real-time inference, ensuring that user requests are processed quickly and efficiently, which is essential for a smooth booking experience.

Below is a sample Python code demonstrating how we might implement the appointment classification model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score ``
    
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('appointments.csv')
   
# Preprocess data
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = data['appointment_type']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
 
# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
         
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```
## üîç How the NLP Model Works
The NLP model is focused on understanding and analyzing user interactions. Here‚Äôs how it contributes:
- **User Query Analysis:** The model processes user queries to provide quick and relevant responses, ensuring that users receive the information they need without delay.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** By analyzing user feedback, the model helps identify areas for improvement in service delivery, enhancing overall user satisfaction.
